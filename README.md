To paint the room, you will need blue and white paint, brushes, rollers, and painter's tape. Start by preparing the room by moving furniture and covering the floors. Apply painter's tape along the edges to ensure clean lines. Begin painting the ceiling white, then proceed to paint the walls with blue. After the first coat dries, apply a second coat if necessary. Allow the paint to cure completely before removing the tape and moving furniture back in.
